# bactrian

bactrian is a tool for testing AI agents the way you would test any other program. It will run your agent as a subprocess, whatever language it is written in and whichever model provider it calls. It records every model call, tool call and network request the agent makes, and can replay a recording exactly, so you can see the precise step where a new version of the agent started behaving differently. It also runs agents live against several models or configurations, repeats each scenario enough times to separate a real change from noise, and tells you whether a change is a regression, an improvement, no change, or still too close to call.

The name comes from the two-humped camel. Most of what bactrian does is compare two things.

## Status

Early development. Recording and strict replay work. Live comparison, statistics, MCP and HTTPS interception, the sandbox and the MCP server are still to come.

## Recording and replaying an agent

An agent talks to bactrian over a small JSON Lines protocol on stdin and stdout: it receives `start`, one `turn` per user message and `end`, and answers each turn with a `reply`. bactrian points the agent's model SDK at its own proxy through the usual base-URL variables (`OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL`, `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`) and gives it placeholder API keys. The real keys stay in bactrian's own environment and are added to requests on their way upstream. [`examples/agents/`](examples/agents/) has a TypeScript agent (build it with `pnpm install --dir examples/agents/typescript` and `pnpm --dir examples/agents/typescript build`) and a Python agent managed by uv.

Record a run (live spending needs an explicit cap per provider, in US dollars):

```sh
BACTRIAN_CAP_OPENAI=0.50 bactrian record --turn "What is the weather in Paris?" -- node examples/agents/typescript/dist/agent.js
```

Replay it without touching the network, and see where a changed agent first behaves differently:

```sh
bactrian replay <run-id> -- node examples/agents/typescript/dist/agent.js
bactrian replay <run-id> --mode until-divergence -- uv run --project examples/agents/python examples/agents/python/agent.py
```

Recordings live in `./.bactrian/runs/`. Each run directory holds the recording (`cassette.jsonl`), a normalised trace of the conversation (`trace.jsonl`), `meta.json` and the agent's stderr. Add `--json` for machine-readable output. Exit status 0 means the run passed, 1 that the agent failed or the replay diverged. `bactrian --help` lists the rest.

## Building from source

You need [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org). From the repository root:

```sh
opam switch create . ocaml-base-compiler.5.5.1 --deps-only --with-test --locked
opam exec -- dune build
opam exec -- dune test
```

The design decisions behind the code are recorded in [`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/).
